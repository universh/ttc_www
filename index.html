        <h4 class="flexboxContentHl">Gameplay First</h4>
        <p>
          When designing our game, gameplay is the main focus. We won't make any
          compromises with gameplay just to soak out some short-term profit of
          our customers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flexboxContent">
        <h4 class="flexboxContentHl">Fair Play</h4>
        <p>
          Fairness is really important in our games and we take it very
          seriously. We will NEVER sell a competitive advantage for money.

    <h4 class="">Idle Valo Clicker</h4>
    <p>
      Dive into the world of VALORANT once more with this licensed action rpg in
      the style of an idle game. Upgrade weapons, slay enemies, promote to
      higher ranks and reach RADIANT. This is our first game and it is really
      emotional for us to see the TTC history come to live.
    </p>
    <h4 class="">LuckyCollex</h4>
    <p>
      In this game, you collect cards to optimize your gameplay. With strategic
      decisions in a Diablo-like loot system, you can battle yourself with your
      friends to see who is the master of LuckyCollex.
    </p>
    <h4 class="">Pong 2000</h4>
    <p>
      The classic: reimagined - reskinned - republished. Nothing more to say
      except we added some power-ups to help you defeat the AI you can battle
      against.
    </p>
    <h4 class="">Coming soon</h4>
    <p>
      We are planning to release a Top-Down discovery turn-based RPG. No more
      spoilers, stay excited!
